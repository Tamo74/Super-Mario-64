            <p>
            In the early 1990s, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a 3D Mario design while developing the game Star Fox (1993) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Star Fox used the Super 
            FX graphics chip, which added more processing power; Miyamoto considered using the chip to develop a Super NES game, Super Mario FX, 
            with gameplay based on "an entire world in miniature, like miniature trains". According to engineer Dylan Cuthbert, who worked on Star Fox, Super Mario FX was never the title of a game, but 
            was the codename of the Super FX chip itself. Miyamoto reformulated the idea for the Nintendo 64, not for its greater power, but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay. At 
            the January 1993 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where Star Fox made its debut, Nintendo's booth demonstrated a talking 3D polygon animation of Mario's head; it returned in the start screen, 
            programmed by Giles Goddard. <br><br>
            
            Production of Super Mario 64 began on September 7, 1994, at Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development division, and concluded on May 20, 1996. According
             to Miyamoto, the development team consisted of around fifteen to twenty people. Development began with the characters and the camera system; months were spent selecting a view and layout. 
             The original concept involved the fixed path of an isometric game such as Super Mario RPG, which moved to a free-roaming 3D design, with some linear paths, particularly to coerce the player into 
             Bowser's lair, according to Giles Goddard. <br><br>
             
             Super Mario 64 is one of the first games for which Nintendo produced its illustrations internally instead of by outsourcing. The graphics were made 
             using N-World, a Silicon Graphics (SGI)-based toolkit. The development team prioritized Mario's movement and, before levels were created, tested and refined Mario's animations on a simple grid.
              The 3D illustrations were created by Shigefumi Hino, Hisashi Nogami, Hideki Fujii, Tomoaki Kuroume, and Yusuke Nakano, and the game was animated by co-director Yoshiaki Koizumi and Satoru Takiwaza.
               Yōichi Kotabe, illustrator and character designer for the Mario series, made a 3D drawing of Mario from various angles and directed the creation of the character models. In an interview with The 
               Washington Post, Yoshiaki Koizumi recalled that his challenge was animating the 3D models without any precedents. To assist players with depth perception, the team positioned a faux shadow directly
                beneath each object regardless of the area's lighting. Yoshiaki Koizumi described the feature as an "iron-clad necessity" which "might not be realistic, but it's much easier to play". <br><br>
    

                Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy was to include more details than earlier games by using the Nintendo 64's power to feature "all the emotions of the characters". He likened the game's style to a 3D
                 interactive cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives; for example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka's wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very 
                 quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work". <br><br>

              Super Mario 64 was first run on an SGI Onyx emulator, which only emulated the console's application programming interface and not its hardware. The first test scenario for controls and physics involved 
              Mario interacting with a golden rabbit, named "MIPS" after the Nintendo 64's MIPS architecture processors; the rabbit was included in the final game as a Power Star holder. Super Mario 64 features more 
              puzzles than earlier Mario games. It was developed simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time but, as Ocarina of Time was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken for Super Mario 64. 
              The developers tried to include a multiplayer cooperative mode, whereby players would control Mario and his brother Luigi in split-screen. Nevertheless, hardware constraints and the developers' inability to implement
               the mode satisfactorily led to its removal. <br><br>
               
               The music was composed by veteran composer Koji Kondo, who created new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier media as well as new material. Yoji 
               Inagaki was responsible for the sound design, tasked with producing hundreds of sound effects. He and Kondo felt that music and sound effects were equally important. According to Inagaki, the average Nintendo 64 game 
               had about 500 sound effects, and made comparisons to Ocarina of Time, with 1,200, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, with 2,000. <br><br>


               Super Mario 64 is one of the first games to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, and Leslie Swan—then senior editor of Nintendo Power and English localizer for Super Mario 64—as the voice of Princess Peach.

                Super Mario 64 was first shown as a playable prototype in November 1995 at Nintendo Space World. This version was only fifty percent complete, and only about two percent of texture mapping was finished. It 
                featured thirty-two courses. Miyamoto had hoped to create more, possibly up to forty, but was ultimately reduced to fifteen. According to Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln, Miyamoto's desire to add more
                 was a major factor in the decision to delay the Nintendo 64 release from Christmas 1995 to Summer 1996. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi later said: "Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise. But
                  users have sharp eyes. They soon know if the games are compromised. [Miyamoto] asked for two more months and I gave them to him unconditionally". The game was later shown at E3 1996 with multiple Nintendo 64s set up 
                  for people to play. According to Giles Goddard, the stress of the project caused some programmers to quit or move to different departments.

                Peter Main, Nintendo's vice president of marketing at the time, stated Super Mario 64 was meant as the killer app for the Nintendo 64. The US$20 million marketing campaign included videotapes sent to more than five hundred 
                thousand Nintendo Power subscribers and advertisements shown on MTV, Fox, and Nickelodeon.<br><br>
                 Super Mario 64 was officially released in Japan in June 1996, North America in September, and in Europe and Australia in
                 March 1997. During its first three months of sale in North America, it sold more than two million copies and grossed $140 million in the United States, becoming the best-selling video game of 1996. It was also 
                 the best-selling game overall from 1995 to 2002. <br><br>
                 During the first three months of 1997, it was the second-best-selling console game at 523,000 units. By early 2001, it had sold 5.5 million units, and 5.9 million by September 2002. At the 1999 Milia festival in 
                 Cannes, Super Mario 64 won a Gold ECCSELL prize for earning revenues above €21 million in the European Union in 1998. It had become the second most popular game on Wii's Virtual Console by June 2007, behind Super Mario Bros.
                  By March 2008, Super Mario 64 sold 11.8 million copies worldwide, being the best-selling Nintendo 64 game. By 2015, Super Mario 64 was the 12th most sold Mario game, with 11.91 million copies sold.

                An enhanced remake, Super Mario 64 DS, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2004. As with the original, the plot centers on collecting Power Stars and rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser. In contrast with the original, Yoshi is the starting character, with Mario, Luigi, and 
                Wario as unlockable characters. It features improved graphics, slightly altered courses, new areas, powerups, and enemies, more Power Stars to collect, touchscreen mini-games, and a multiplayer mode. Reviews were mostly positive, with critics praising the graphics and 
                add-ons to the original game but criticizing the controls and multiplayer mode. By September 2021, 11.06 million copies had been sold worldwide.

              A version of Super Mario 64 was used as a tech demo for the Nintendo 64 Disk Drive (64DD) floppy drive at the 1996 Nintendo Space World trade show. Like Wave Race 64, Super Mario 64 was re-released in Japan on July 18, 1997 as Super Mario 64 Rumble Pak Version[a] which fixed various bugs, added support for the Rumble Pak peripheral, included the voice acting from the English version, among other changes.<br><br>

              In November 2003, it was ported to China's iQue Player as a limited-release demo. In late 2006, it was released on the Wii Virtual Console service which added enhanced resolution and compatibility with the GameCube and Super Famicom Classic controllers. In September 2020, Super Mario 64 was one of the three Super Mario games to be included in the Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Nintendo Switch. This version was based on the Rumble Pak iteration, and updated the game's presentation to display at 720p resolution in both the Switch's docked and handheld configurations, in addition to using upscaled user interface assets and textures. It also features a new control scheme that accommodates the wider button array of the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con and Pro Controller, and was later patched to add compatibility for the Nintendo 64 controller used with the Nintendo Classics service. It made another Nintendo Switch appearance in October 2021 as part of the Nintendo 64 lineup for the Nintendo Classics service.
